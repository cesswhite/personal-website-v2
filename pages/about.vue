      Hi!
      My name is CÃ©sar, on the internet world I use the nickname of
      <span class="underline italic">
        cesswhite
      </span>
      (abbreviation of my name and my favorite color)
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm a Front End Developer with 4+ years of experience in this area, but, in the last two years, I have been
      studying and training as a UI Designer, creating projects from scratch to
      production.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have always liked the combination of technology and art. That's why I love to keep discovering new
      technologies,
      trends and breaking the mold of everything.
      <br>
      <br>
      I currently aim to learn as much as I can in a work environment and to further my own abilities in a
      professional and
      personal setting.
      <br>
      <br>
      Join me on this journey.
      <br>

      Funny? Absolutely sure!
